## Overview

**Dungeon Rush** is a strategic, asymmetric, dungeon-crawl memory game.

- One player is the **Dungeon Master** (defense), laying traps to stop the adventurers.
- The other player controls the **Adventurers** (offense), spending gold to spawn and move units in an attempt to escape the dungeon.
- The dungeon is built in rows extending from the adventurers’ starting side (row 1) to the dungeon master’s side (most recently placed row), where escape is attempted. Offense units spawn on the first row and aim to reach the final row to win.
- The game can be played solo or versus another player.

---

## Versus Mode

A round consists of two matches:

- **Match A** – Player 1 is Dungeon Master; Player 2 is Adventurers
- **Match B** – Player 1 is Adventurers; Player 2 is Dungeon Master

A point is awarded only if a player wins both matches in the round. First to 3 points wins the game.

---

## Match Structure

- **Defense** takes the first turn.
- Each turn has two phases:
	- **Defense Turn** – Lay trap tiles.
	- **Offense Turn** – Gain gold, spawn units, and move units.

---

## Defense Turn

Each turn the defense adds a new row of potentially dangerous traps (tiles) to the dungeon paths:

1. Draw 3 tiles randomly from the bag.
2. Look at them, then place them face down, one per path.

**First turn only:**
- Draw and lay 9 tiles (3 per path) to form the starting dungeon length.

---

## Offense Turn

- Gain 4 gold each turn.
- Gain +1 gold per active (alive) unit in the dungeon not trapped in a cage.

### Offense Actions

- Offense may spawn and move units in any order, any number of times, as long as they can pay the gold cost.

#### Spawning Units

- Spawn any unspawned unit by paying its spawn cost.
- A spawned unit is placed immediately on any open tile (no unit occupying it).
- You may spawn onto a cage trap containing a trapped unit to free it.
- Units that died this turn cannot be respawned this turn.

#### Moving Units

- A unit may be moved any number of times as long as gold is paid each time.
- Movement triggers tile reveal unless prevented (e.g., jumping over tiles).
