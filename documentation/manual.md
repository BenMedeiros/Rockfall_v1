## Overview

**Dungeon Rush** is a strategic, asymmetric, dungeon-crawl memory game.

- One player is the **Dungeon Master** (defense), laying traps to stop the **Adventurers**.
- The other player controls the **Adventurers**, spending gold to spawn and move units in an attempt to escape the dungeon.
- The dungeon is built in rows extending from the **Adventurers**’ starting side (row 1) to the dungeon master’s side (most recently placed row), where escape is attempted. **Adventurers** units spawn on the first row and aim to reach the final row to win.
- The game can be played solo or versus another player.

## Versus Mode

### Match Structure

- **Dungeon Master** takes the first turn.
- Each turn has two phases:
  - **Dungeon Master Turn** – Lay trap tiles.
  - **Adventurers Turn** – Gain gold, spawn units, and move units.

### Dungeon Master Turn

Each turn the **Dungeon Master** adds a new row of potentially dangerous traps (tiles) to the dungeon paths:

1. Draw 3 tiles randomly from the bag.
2. Look at them, then place them face down, one per path.

**First turn only:**
- Draw and lay 9 tiles (3 per path) to form the starting dungeon length.

### Adventurers Turn

- Gain 4 gold each turn.
- Gain +1 gold per active (alive) unit in the dungeon not trapped in a cage.
- **Adventurers** may spawn and move units (Adventurers) in any order, any number of times, as long as they can pay the gold cost.

##### Spawning Units

- **Adventurers** may spawn any unspawned unit by paying its spawn cost.
- A spawned unit is placed immediately on any open tile (no unit occupying it).
- **Adventurers** may spawn onto a cage trap containing a trapped unit to free it.
- Units that died this turn cannot be respawned this turn.

##### Moving Units

- A unit may be moved any number of times as long as gold is paid each time.
- Movement triggers tile reveal unless prevented (e.g., jumping over tiles).

### Abilities

| Ability   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Move 1    | Move to any orthogonally adjacent tile. |
| Move 2    | Move 1. If the first step is not affected by a trap or obstruction, move 1 again. |
| Jump 1    | Jump over one adjacent tile, landing two spaces away. Can jump orthogonally or diagonally. Does not reveal the jumped tile. Can jump over walls. Cannot land on an adjacent tile. |
| Bomb 1    | Destroy current and adjacent tiles; all units on destroyed tiles die. |
| Reveal 1  | Choose one adjacent tile to reveal, and trigger its on reveal; revealed treasure still requires a unit to move to the location for collection |

### Unit Typess

| Unit     | Spawn Cost | Move Cost | Ability |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Basic    | 2g         | 1g        | Move 1 |
| Sprinter | 3g         | 1g        | Move 2 |
| Jumper   | 3g         | 1g        | Jump 1 |
| Scout    | 4g         | 2g        | Move 1; if movement succeeds, Reveal 1|
| Bomber   | 4g         | 1g        | Move 1; On death: Bomb 1 |

### Tile Types

| Tile Type        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Blank            | Safe tile. |
| Spike Trap       | On reveal: the unit on this tile dies. |
| Cage Trap        | On reveal: the unit on the tile becomes trapped.<br>If a unit enters a cage containing another trapped unit: the new unit becomes trapped and the freed unit is immediately moved to any adjacent tile.<br>If no adjacent tiles are available, the unit is killed. |
| Oil Slick Trap   | Unit continues moving in the same direction it entered. If no tile exists ahead, the unit stays on this tile. |
| Pushback Trap    | On reveal: push the unit back one tile. If no tile exists, the unit stays in place. |
| Bomb Trap    | On reveal: Bomb 1 |
| Wall             | Movement into this tile is blocked. <br>**Special interactions:** <ul><li>Cage-freed movement: dead end - choose a different location.</li><li>Oil Slick: bounce off the wall - reverse direction.</li><li>Pushback Trap: unit remains on pushback tile.</li></ul> |
| Treasure         | On reveal: gain 4 gold. If no unit is standing on the treasure when revealed, a unit must move to the tile to collect. Treasure stays face-up after collection. |

### Tile Reset

- At the end of each turn: All non-occupied tiles (except collected treasure) are turned face down again.
- **Adventurers** may leave a unit on a trap tile to prevent it from re-revealing next turn.

### Win Conditions

#### Adventurers Win

If any **Adventurers** unit:

- Reaches the last row/tile of any path, **and**
- Survives the reveal on that tile.

*Jumpers must still use Jump 1; they cannot Move 1 on the last row.*

#### Dungeon Master Wins

If on the **Dungeon Master** turn, the dungeon master does not have enough tiles remaining to lay all three path tiles.

---

## Solo Mode

Solo Mode plays just like Versus, but instead of an opponent you face the bag. You play as just the **Adventurers**.

- When you add the 3 tiles each turn, do **not** look at them. Place them face down and see if you can get lucky!
- All other rules for the **Adventurers** apply as in Versus Mode.

### Solo Mode Difficulties

Set the starting dungeon length (number of rows) to adjust the challenge:

| Difficulty | Starting Dungeon Length |
|------------|------------------------|
| Base Game  | 3                      |
| Hard       | 4                      |
| Brutal     | 5                      |
| Insane     | 6 (requires skill and luck) |

Try to win at each level and see how far you can get!
